eatmydata-sc -- A non-portable eatmydata replacement using seccomp
==================================================================
eatmydata-sc is similar to eatmydata, a tool to disable file syncing. It is
implemented using seccomp-bpf and disables all explicit sync()-like calls.

It does not support the open() call with O_SYNC parameters or similar.
